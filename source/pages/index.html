        <h1>Jake Coppinger</h1>

<h3>
I'm studying my third year of Computer Science at UNSW in Sydney, though I also love filmmaking, electronics and design.</h3>
<h3>
So far I have represented Australia at the Intel International Science Fair in Los Angeles, presented a talk at TEDxSydney on my gesture recognition research and grown my filmmaking YouTube channel to a profitable 3.6m views/57k subscribers. I also play the violin - solo and with an orchestra.</h3>
<h3>
I've been constantly tinkering since I was handed-down a very old Meccano set at a young age. I attended a Steiner school until year 9, learning various programming languages and electronics in my own time. I then moved to a selective public school so I could pursue science and technology in more depth.</h3>
<h3>
I moved to Sydney to study my passion, and in my spare time I have been visualising realtime Sydney public transit data, using computer vision to visualise how pedestrians use public spaces and exploring notifications as an interface.</h3>
