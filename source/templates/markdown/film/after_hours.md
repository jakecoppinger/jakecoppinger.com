A few of my friends were heading out skateboarding around Sydney so I joined them with my Canon 60D and Canon 50mm f/1.8 and shot handheld for the night. Great fun! The film is about the mistakes and trips you don't usually see.

Shooting handheld and without extra lighting meant I had to push the ISO pretty hard which the 60D doesn't like much, please forgive the noise. I would've liked to have shot in RAW but I can only get 7 seconds on the 60D so I chose to roll for longer in H.264. DaVinci Resolve did a pretty good job with the noise reduction and some moderate grading but I couldn't push it too hard.
