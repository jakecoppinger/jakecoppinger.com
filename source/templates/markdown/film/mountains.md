I shot this film at various moments when I travelled to Colorado, while still experiencing the adventure to the fullest.

I filmed this on my Canon 60D with with both the Samyang 35mm f1.4 and Canon 17-85 EFS lenses. I did about 75% of the shots in RAW using [Magic Lantern](https://www.magiclantern.fm) which gave me incredible power to colour grade but also created some moire. I edited and graded the film in DaVinci Resolve.

Set to [Honest Affection by Kye Kye, the stripped session version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYuYpnEk-ik). As soon as I heard the stripped version I knew I had to make a film for it, definitely check [Kye Kye](http://kyekyemusic.com/) out.
