Magic Lantern is a free software add on for your Canon DSLR that effectively upgrades its features. This tutorial goes over the Magic Lantern installation, some tips on getting started with the extra features for filmmaking, and some safety tips to make sure it doesn't damage your camera.

Something I forgot to mention: Magic Lantern has not been updated for the latest firmware on the Canon 5D Mark III. The latest firmware Magic Lantern supports is `1.2.3`. You can downgrade using the Eos Utility app.
